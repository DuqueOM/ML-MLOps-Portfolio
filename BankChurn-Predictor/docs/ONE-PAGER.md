# BankChurn Predictor — One-Pager

> **TL;DR**: Production-grade ML system for predicting bank customer churn with 87% AUC-ROC, served via FastAPI with Prometheus metrics.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Banks lose significant revenue when customers leave (churn). Early identification of at-risk customers enables proactive retention strategies, reducing churn by up to 25%.

## 🔧 Solution

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Customer Data] --> B[Preprocessing]
    B --> C[VotingClassifier]
    C --> D[Churn Probability]
    D --> E[Retention Action]
```

**Ensemble model** combining LogisticRegression + RandomForest with automated resampling for class imbalance handling.

## 📊 Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Business Impact |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **AUC-ROC** | 0.87 | Strong discrimination |
| **F1-Score** | 0.64 | Balanced precision/recall |
| **Lift@10%** | 3.4x | 3.4x better than random |
| **Latency** | <50ms | Real-time decisions |

## 🚀 Quick Demo

```bash
# Start API
docker run -p 8001:8000 ghcr.io/duqueom/bankchurn-api:latest

# Make prediction
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"CreditScore":650,"Geography":"France","Gender":"Female","Age":40,"Tenure":3,"Balance":60000,"NumOfProducts":2,"HasCrCard":1,"IsActiveMember":1,"EstimatedSalary":50000}'

# Response
# {"churn_probability":0.23,"churn_prediction":0,"risk_level":"LOW"}
```

## 📈 Model Explainability

Top factors influencing churn (SHAP analysis):

1. **Age** (+0.21) — Older customers churn more
2. **NumOfProducts** (+0.18) — Single-product customers at risk
3. **IsActiveMember** (+0.16) — Inactive = high risk
4. **Geography** (+0.14) — Germany has higher churn
